# Pokémon API Website

The Pokémon API Website is a showcase of my first project involving APIs. It demonstrates my journey of learning how to fetch data from an external API and use it to create a web application. The primary focus of this project is to display information about different Pokémon species using data obtained from a Pokémon API.

Through this website, I am sharing my experience of working with APIs for the first time. It allows users to explore a list of Pokémon, view their names, and learn about their basic details. This project represents my initial steps into the world of web development and showcases how I integrated external data to create a simple yet informative website.

I hope you enjoy exploring the Pokémon API Website and witness my progress in understanding APIs and building web applications. Thank you for being a part of my learning journey!
